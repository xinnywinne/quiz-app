# 📝 Quiz App

Welcome! As the world's largest interview prep community and learning platform, we're always working to build better learning experiences for our users. This project is designed to give you a fun, hands-on example of what it would be like to develop products at Exponent.

## Assignment

In this takehome assignment, you'll be building the API for a simple **Quiz app** that allows the user to take a multiple choice quiz, which will be graded automatically by the server for instant feedback.

The user interface for the quiz won't be part of this project—instead it's up to you to create the backend API that the UI will eventually integrate with. Don't worry about persisting data or user authentication for now–that's out of scope for this project.

> Note: We've set up a simple server using Node and Express.js to make it easier to get started with building. You should be able to accomplish the project without additional dependencies, but feel free to import more libraries if you want.

Here's the list of features we'd like our app to support:
* Fetching quiz data from the API 
* Submitting quiz answers and returning the grade to the client
* Test coverage - we've stubbed out a few test cases for you to get started

You can refer to the documentation below to understand what API endpoints to implement.

## Evaluation
We'll evaluate your submission on the following criteria:
* Functionality: Does your solution work as intended and meet the spec for the API? Do you handle errors correctly?
* Craft: Does your code follow best practices and expected behavior? Is your code easy to read and commented appropriately?

## Development

To get started, download the repo or click "Use this template" to create a private version of this project. 
After downloading the repo, go to the directory and run 
```
npm install
```
followed by 
```
npm start
```
You can access the local server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can then create or modify files in the `src/` directory.

To run the tests (not yet implemented), run `npm test`.
